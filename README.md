# Awesome-Bioinformatics
Curated List of awesome Bioinformatics resources.

es gibt schon eine Liste:

Aber wir k√∂nnen ja unsere (bessere) eigene machen :D

### SNPs and variants:
* How to find SNPs in a 3D structure: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/guide/howto/view-mut-3d/
* SNP mapping, structure annotation and visualisation: http://mupit.icm.jhu.edu/MuPIT_Interactive/
  * doi:10.1007/s00439-013-1325-0
  
### Reproducibility and scientific workflows 
[![**`Nextflow`**](https://www.nextflow.io/img/nextflow2014_no-bg.png)](https://www.nextflow.io/)

is a great tool for automatisation and workflow execution. It is open source and easily portable between infrastructures. The possibility for containerization support is securing the reproducibility of executed workflows.
There are already loads of bioinformatics workflows available and the future of the project is ensured by numberous institutions using **`Nextflow`**.

[![**`nf-core`**](https://nf-co.re/assets/img/logo/nf-core-logo.svg)](https://nf-co.re/) 

is a community effort to collect a curated set of analysis pipelines built using Nextflow.
